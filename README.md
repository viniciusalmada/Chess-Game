## Used resources

### Project environment

This project is developed as a Visual Studio solution, version 2019 precisely.

### Programming language

The language is C++ with a focus on OO programming including the use of compositions and singleton classes.

Some classes act only like a holder for static functions like the [GlUtils](include/gl_utils.h).

### Libraries

* [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/): The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library 

  This lib facilitates the use of low-level OpenGL calls.

* [IUP](https://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/): Portable User Interface

  IUP is a multi-platform toolkit for building graphical user interfaces. It offers a simple API in C/C++ and Lua. This library was developed at Tecgraf/PUC-Rio.

* [IM](https://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/im/): An Imaging Toolkit

  IM is a toolkit for image representation, storage, capture, and processing. The main goal of the library is to provide a simple API and abstraction of imaging for scientific applications.
